# CatLearn

CatLearn utilieties machine learning in form of Gaussian Process or Student T process to accelerate catalysis simulations. The Nudged-elastic-band method (NEB) is accelerated with MLNEB code. Furthermore, a global adsorption search is accelerated with the MLGO code. 
CalLearn uses ASE for handling the atomic systems and the calculator interface for the potential energy calculations.

## Installation

You can simply install CatLearn as:
```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/avishart/CatLearn/tree/database-reduction
```
Then go into the directory and write:
```shell
$ pip install -e .
```
