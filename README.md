# CatLearn

CatLearn utilieties machine learning in form of Gaussian Process or Student T process to accelerate catalysis simulations. The Nudged-elastic-band method (NEB) is accelerated with MLNEB code. Furthermore, a global adsorption search is accelerated with the MLGO code. 
CalLearn uses ASE for handling the atomic systems and the calculator interface for the potential energy calculations.

## Installation

You can simply install CatLearn by dowloading it from github as:
```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/avishart/CatLearn/tree/uncertainty_driven
$ pip install -e CatLearn/.
```
or
```shell
$ pip install git@github.com:avishart/CatLearn.git@uncertainty_driven
```
